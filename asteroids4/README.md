Asteriods is based off of the hit game Asteroids by Atari. 
In my implementation the ship can fly around and loops through the sides of the GUI and apears on the other side. The rocks act in the same mannor and you keep shooting until all  
the rocks have broken appart to their smallest form and you destroy them or be destroyed.
